Let's continue from where we left off in the [previous post]({% post_url 2024-01-04-hr1 %}). I highly recommend reading Part #1 first, but I'll give you a quick overview.

## Context

I want to know if with a Raspberry Pi 3B without a screen, I can:
1. ~~Record from an audio interface using arecord?~~
2. Record from two audio interfaces simultaneously using arecord?
3. Use a web service to trigger the recording?
4. Connect and send the commands directly to the Pi as a hotspot?

Today, we'll tackle item #2.

## Hands-on

I have a [Boss GT1](https://www.boss.info/br/products/gt-1/). A delight. Small, light, and _good enoughÂ®_. Most importantly, it is a USB audio interface.

_You're tough!_

Let's plug it into the pi and see what happens.

In the [first article of this series]({% post_url 2024-01-04-hr1 %}), we saw how to list the capture interfaces with `arecord`:

```
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 2: CODEC [USB Audio CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 3: GT1 [GT-1], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

Beautiful! The board 3 appeared, and now with a name that makes sense. Makes me wonder why the Behringer has the name CODEC ðŸ¤”.

I'm lazy. Let's try the same command that worked before, just changing the interface:

```
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
arecord: set_params:1343: Sample format non available
Available formats:
- S32_LE
```

Well, S32, 32-bit? The manual says 24, but who am I to complain ðŸ˜…? S32_LE it is then!

```
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S32_LE -r 44100 -c 2 opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
```

Yay ðŸŽ‰!

So excited, I forgot to plug in the guitar, but it was on a noisy effect.

<audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/wav" src="/files/hr2/gt1.wav"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
<a href="/files/hr2/gt1.wav" target="_blank">How cute is this psychedelic noise!</a>

Great! Now, I need to see if I can record with both interfaces simultaneously.

For that, I'll need to execute both commands at the same time in the command line.

In Linux, if you put an & right after a command, it will be invoked and sent to the background. In other words, the program will be running, but the terminal will be free to run another command.

Let's take advantage of this by doing the following: COMMAND_TO_RECORD_FROM_GT1 & COMMAND_TO_RECORD_FROM_BEHRINGER.

Notice the & in the middle of one command and another. This will make the first command be invoked, sent to the background, and immediately after, the second command will be invoked.

Is this running at the same time? No, but for our purposes here, it's good enough.

Remember, this is a prototype. I just want to see if it works. I wouldn't do it like this in a product development situation. Let's see that in the future.

Let's modify the commands a bit too so that each one goes to its separate file. The GT1 recording goes to the gt1.wav file, and the Behringer goes to the beh.wav file.

It will look like this:

COMMAND_TO_RECORD_FROM_GT1: arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S32_LE -r 44100 -c 2 gt1.wav

COMMAND_TO_RECORD_FROM_BEHRINGER: arecord -Dhw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 beh.wav

Since I don't have 3 available instruments, I'll do the following:

On Behringer:

I'll speak into the microphone.
I'll tap the cable with my foot. It will make a "bad contact" noise.
On GT1:

I'll play a chord on the guitar.
Here we go:

```
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S32_LE -r 44100 -c 2 gt1.wav & arecord -Dhw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 beh.wav
[2] 19853
Recording WAVE 'gt1.wav' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Recording WAVE 'beh.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, StereoRate 44100 Hz, Stereo

[1]   Done                    arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S32_LE -r 44100 -c 2 gt1.wav
[2]+  Done                    arecord -Dhw:CARD=GT1,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S32_LE -r 44100 -c 2 gt1.wav
```

The output was a bit confusing this time, but the important thing is to see that in the third line, we have two pieces of information:

Recording WAVE 'gt1.wav' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz
Recording WAVE 'beh.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, StereoRate 44100 Hz, Stereo
In other words, we are recording the gt1.wav file with 32 bits and the beh.wav with 16 bits, indicating that each file has the correct parameters.

Let's see how each file turned out:

### beh.wav
<audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/wav" src="/files/hr2/beh_conjunto.wav"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
<a href="/files/hr2/beh_conjunto.wav" target="_blank">If your browser doesn't load, click here</a>.

### gt1.wav
<audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/wav" src="/files/hr2/gt1_conjunto.wav"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
<a href="/files/hr2/gt1_conjunto.wav" target="_blank">If your browser doesn't load, click here</a>.

## Conclusion

It seems to have worked!

So, `arecord` allows me to record simultaneously from multiple interfaces, just call it several times.

It may be, with emphasis on "may," that we'll have synchronization problems with multiple audios, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

But when recording with the band, I won't have a command line available, and it wouldn't be practical.

In the next post, we'll create a simple web application to do exactly what we did today, without needing a command line.
