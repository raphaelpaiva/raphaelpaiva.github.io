## The Problem

* I have a band (🍪).
* We like to record ourselves 🌚, both audio and video.
* We have an old sound mixer with a USB interface 🎚️.
* We have an old single-core, 32-bit netbook 💻.
* We eventually want to record multitrack with an additional interface or combine several for better mixing 🎛️.
* We have smartphones for recording videos 📹.
* I have an [app](https://github.com/raphaelpaiva/cameracontrol) that controls smartphone cameras (Android only) 📱.
* We're not sure if it will work because the netbook is quite old and slow. Yes, I want to invent before testing.

Well, I have a spare Raspberry Pi 3 🍓.

What's the problem? None, I want to invent something 😄.

## The Idea

The main idea is: A portable recorder, **easy to use** (plug in the interface(s) and press record). And by record, I mean:
1. Record audio from the interfaces.
2. Send the recording command to the cameras.

## Limitations

If I'm not mistaken, we have [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/) (a Linux audio system) by default on [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). It's possible to aggregate interfaces (combine several into one), but you can also launch several processes of [arecord](https://linux.die.net/man/1/arecord) (the default ALSA recording program) to record audio from different interfaces at the same time, which seems simpler.

Well, the Raspberry Pi doesn't have a screen, and I don't plan to add one. Buttons might be a good idea, but at least initially, I'll need more control, especially since I'll be exploring, right?

If there's no screen, there's no graphical interface. It might be possible to run a [Reaper](https://reaper.fm) and try to do some magic, but I think we have simpler solutions, at least for now. Probably, I'll go for a web interface to control it with a phone or tablet.

To access the web interface, I'll need to connect to the Pi in a potentially network-less environment, so I'll have to sacrifice the Pi's wifi to create a hotspot where the controller will connect. It's not much different from how digital interfaces work.

For the cameras, I have my project mentioned above, but the most important thing is the audio. Even more important is:

> Given a Raspberry Pi 3B with an audio interface connected, can I connect directly to it via wifi with a tablet and send commands to record audio?

## Prototype

Let's go.

I have some things to test.

1. Can I record from an audio interface using arecord?
2. Can I record from two audio interfaces simultaneously using arecord?
3. Can I use a web service to trigger recording?
4. Can I connect and send the above commands directly to the Pi as a hotspot?

## Hands-On

Let's try to tackle the first item.

I reinstalled the Pi and plugged in my interface into one of the USB ports. Let's see if ALSA detected it.

I know there's a command to record audio directly from the command line, part of the ALSA "toolbox," called `arecord`.

Let's try:

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord
Usage: arecord [OPTION]... [FILE]...
-h, --help              help
    --version           print current version
-l, --list-devices      list all soundcards and digital audio devices
-L, --list-pcms         list device names
-D, --device=NAME       select PCM by name
...
```

It politely called me dumb.

`Usage: arecord [OPTION]... [FILE]...` tells me how to use this command. I have to pass options (at least one) or files (at least one) to it.

Let's try passing any file; it should be the destination file for recording.

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord opa.wav
arecord: main:830: audio open error: No such file or directory
```

Okay, error opening the audio. Sounds a bit strange. Since in Linux everything is represented by a file, including my audio interface, I suspect it couldn't open the audio device. Maybe I have to inform `arecord` of _which_ interface I want to record. What if there's more than one?

From the output above, where the options were listed, some caught my attention. The first one was:

```shellscript
-l, --list-devices      list all soundcards and digital audio devices
```

Let's try passing this option!

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 2: CODEC [USB Audio CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

Hey! This output means it detected an output device.

Translating:

* `card 2: CODEC [USB Audio CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]`
  - This device is on card number 2 (`card 2`).
  - The name of this card is `CODEC [USB Audio CODEC]`.
  - The output device is the first device on this card (`device 0`).
  - Its name is `USB Audio [USB Audio]`.
* `Subdevices: 1/1`
  - It has one subdevice.
* `Subdevice #0: subdevice #0`
  - This subdevice is number 0.

Understood? Not really, but it seems that ALSA refers to devices by numbers or names.

From the ALSA manual, there's another interesting option:

```shellscript
-L, --list-pcms
        List all PCMs defined
```

What the heck is a PCM? It's an acronym for [Pulse-code modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation), or one of the ways a computer can "hear." In the context of ALSA, PCM is what comes from your capture device, meaning this option lists the available audio sources.

I'll write about PCM later; it's very interesting, but let's not get into that now.

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -L
null
    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Direct hardware device without any conversions
plughw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Hardware device with all software conversions
default:CARD=CODEC


    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Default Audio Device
sysdefault:CARD=CODEC
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Default Audio Device
front:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Front output / input
dsnoop:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Direct sample snooping device
```

We have a bit more information from this `arecord -L` option. Two sections catch the eye:

```shellscript
hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Direct hardware device without any conversions
plughw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0
    USB Audio CODEC, USB Audio
    Hardware device with all software conversions
```

It seems we have access to raw data from the hardware with `hw:` and access to treated data with `plughw:`. What difference does this make? I don't know. I'll guess that there might be some format and sample rate conversions, but there's something more important:

`hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0` really looks like a device identifier. `CODEC` is the name of the card we saw in the `arecord -l` output, and 0 is the device number, so `hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0` should mean the direct hardware audio source coming from the CODEC card, device 0. Similarly, `plughw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0` should mean the same audio source but with software conversions, whatever that means.

The translation of the rest of the `arecord -L` output is left as an exercise for the reader 😄.

A third option that caught my attention was:

```shellscript
-D, --device=NAME       select PCM by name
```

It really looks like this option is how I tell which interface I want to use. I just need to figure out if we go with `hw:` or `plughw`. Since `plughw` does conversions, it seems to be the safer bet.

Let's go.

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dplughw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
```

Seems like it's recording!

As I didn't know how to stop the recording, I just pressed ctrl+C (standard for aborting programs on the command line) and let's see what happened.

Listen to the nerd's joy [here](/files/hr/opa.wav).

It sounds like Yuri Gagarin's audio with crappy quality. Well, with 8 bits of resolution and a sample rate of 8kHz, you can't expect much.

Let's see if we can improve that, but I'm curious to know what happens if I use `hw:`.

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dhw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
arecord: set_params:1343: Sample format non available
Available formats:
- S8
- S16_LE
```

Hey! I like errors like this. It tells me what I did wrong and how to fix it:

```shellscript
arecord: set_params:1343: Sample format non available
Available formats:
- S8
- S16_LE
```

So, I have to specify the sample format. In the first output of the program, you can see how, and there are some interesting options to control quality and duration.

```shellscript
-c, --channels=#        channels
-f, --format=FORMAT     sample format (case insensitive)
-r, --rate=#            sample rate
-d, --duration=#        interrupt after # seconds
```

Let's only play with the format for now, which is what it complained about.

```shellscript
raphaelpaiva@hr:~ $ arecord -Dhw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 -f S16_LE opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
Warning: rate is not accurate (requested = 8000Hz, got = 11025Hz)
         please, try the plug plugin
```

It gave a warning but recorded. I'm going to cry 😭. Listen to the nerd's cry [here](/files/hr/opahw.wav).

Did you notice that the quality seems much better? This was the jump from 8 bits/8000Hz to 16 bits/11025Hz. Impressive.

Let's see if we can play a bit with the other parameters.

I want to record a 5-second audio, 16 bits, 44100Hz, and using both channels of the interface. I'll plug my guitar into the second channel, and let's see if smoke comes out.

```shellscript
arecord -Dhw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0 -d 5 -f S16_LE -r 44100 -c 2 opa.wav
Recording WAVE 'opa.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
```

Listen to it [here](/files/hr/opa2canais.wav).

## Conclusion

It works!

We've seen how to record audio from an audio interface via the command line using ALSA, the standard sound system on Raspberry Pi OS.

[In the next step]({% post_url 2024-01-05-hr2 %}), let's see if we can record from two interfaces simultaneously.

Follow me!
